//! What a shared pack says about itself, beyond what a `.mrpack` can.
//!
//! A Geode pack file **is** a `.mrpack` — `modrinth.index.json`, `overrides/`,
//! `client-overrides/`, `server-overrides/`, all at the root and all valid —
//! with one extra directory, `geode/`, alongside them. Nothing is nested and
//! nothing is wrapped.
//!
//! That shape is the whole design. The index *instructs*: it holds every byte
//! another launcher needs to rebuild a working instance, so Prism or the
//! Modrinth app open a Geode pack as an ordinary modpack and get it right. The
//! manifest here only *annotates*: the launcher settings, artwork and
//! provenance that `.mrpack` has nowhere to put. Delete `geode/` and the pack
//! must still install correctly elsewhere — there is a test for exactly that.
//!
//! The corollary is a rule worth stating: never write a download URL into this
//! half. The moment the same fact lives in both places they can disagree, and
//! the index is the one other software reads.
